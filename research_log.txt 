1, Do we need to remove the outliers 

2, What do we do when we have v = f(sigma) 

3, :

1, Using analytic function to fit the parameters 

=> pair functions phi = use gljm 

=> transfer function  rho = use Mishin 

=> embedding function  
	(a) FS 
	(b) universal (ref: Analytic embedded atom method model for bcc metals) 

=> dipole angular term   
	(a) try tersoff_pot 

=> quadrupole term w = 
	(a) try tersoff_pot 

2, 
	# test cutoff 
	0, evo1 cutoff 5.19 

	1, evo2 cutoff 5.29  = 
	2, evo3 cutoff 5.41  = 

	3, evo4 cutoff 5.52 
	4, evo5 cutoff 5.61  bad  

	between 5.29 to 5.49 !!! 

3,  
	calculate w lattice constant, and ideal shear


4, we need to compare it: 

emphase the the anlyaisc is useful is consistant with  melecualr static quantion 
=> 	1, energy 
	2, force, 
	3, stress 	
we already compare the energy

1, Nature peper reply 
	one page 	

2, PRB, ideal strengh 
	idea shear (211) and (110) W , WRe50  

3, potential fitting 
	a: extrapolate 
	b: TP => high strain data ; OP=> low strain data 	
	
4, prepare you Al dislocation dyanmics data (Precipiates) [one figure] with eplanation. 
5, WRe50 dislocation core; the calculation was stopped before finish.
