July 2 
/scratch/qiliang_flux/chaomy/QE/VC_WRe/Bcc_QE_VCA_WRe25_ishear211 
=> dir-004 and dir-018 are unfinished calculations 

Jun 16 
1, Do we need to remove the outliers 

2, What do we do when we have v = f(sigma) 

3, :

Jun 17 
1, Using analytic function to fit the parameters 

=> pair functions phi = use gljm 

=> transfer function  rho = use Mishin 

=> embedding function  
	(a) FS 
	(b) universal (ref: Analytic embedded atom method model for bcc metals) 

=> dipole angular term   
	(a) try tersoff_pot 

=> quadrupole term w = 
	(a) try tersoff_pot 

2, 
	# test cutoff 
	0, evo1 cutoff 5.19 

	1, evo2 cutoff 5.29  = 
	2, evo3 cutoff 5.41  = 

	3, evo4 cutoff 5.52 
	4, evo5 cutoff 5.61  bad  

	between 5.29 to 5.49 !!! 
3,  
	calculate w lattice constant, and ideal shear

4, we need to compare it: 
emphase the the anlyaisc is useful is consistant with  melecualr static quantion 
=> 	1, energy 
	2, force, 
	3, stress 	
we already compare the energy

Jun 18 
1, Nature peper reply 
	one page 	

2, PRB, ideal strengh 
	idea shear (211) and (110) W , WRe50  

3, potential fitting 
	a: extrapolate 
	b: TP => high strain data ; OP=> low strain data 	
	
4, prepare you Al dislocation dyanmics data (Precipiates) [one figure] with eplanation. 
5, WRe50 dislocation core; the calculation was stopped before finish.

Jun 19 
1, => Fit the average length besed on model (eqn(3)) to the dd simulation (based on 1 and 2)  
2, => use new mobility function to fit the results 
3, => after check the convergence => r = 5.29 is the most properly cutoff 
---> thinki about modifies the potential !!!!! 
4, => in order to calculate the correct scale of Peierls Potential barrier => the cutoff has 
to be at least 5.20 A !!!!!!  (smaller cutoff you can never get correct peierls barrier) 
that means we must include 3nd neighbor of FCC lattice structure. 

Jun 20
1, extrapolate along emF to see whether we can remove the singularity
As I extrapolate of emF, the energy curve of TP becomes nicer. 

Jun 22
